            <h1><span class="orange-color">Vote for</span> Change!</h1>
            <h3>Let's work together to build a safer & better campus for everyone.</h3>

            <P>
                I have three major objectives which are: 

                <li>
                    Promote equality and diversity: All students should be treated as equal regardless their nationality, race, gender & sexual orientation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hear students’ concerns:  Every voice must be heard and all problems students have should be considered to be solved.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Tuition fees concarn: I’ll run a campaign regarding the raise of international tuition fees throughout the entire year. 
                </li>
            </P>

            <h3> <span class="orange-color">I will be a voice for all the international students living on and off campus</span> </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ensure smoother transitions and inductions during and after Freshers Week so that international students can easily adjust and feel at home at university.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Encourage international students to take advantage of the social aspect of university life by persuading them to join and take part in social and sporting activities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Develop better relationships with the university’s international societies, organisations and offices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implement a feedback system for International students where they can personally share their experiences at the university and what they would like to see improved, addressed or looked into in the future.
